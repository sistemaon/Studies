            <ul>
                <div class="">
                    <li><strong>1873</strong> - Born in Palmira (today named Santos Dumont), Minas Gerais</li>
                    <li><strong>1891</strong> - Santos Dumont's father was partially paralyzed by a fall from a horse.
                        He sold the plantation and went to Europe with his wife and Santos Dumont in search of
                        treatment. He returned to Brazil with his parents at the end of the year.</li>
                    <li><strong>1892</strong> - The family returned to Europe, but his father felt too ill to continue
                        on to Paris from Lisbon, and Santos Dumont made the journey on his own. His father's health
                        deteriorated and he decided to return to Brazil, where he died on August 30.</br> For the next
                        four years Alberto lived in Paris, studying physics, chemistry, mechanics, and electricity with
                        the help of a private tutor, and returning to Brazil for short holidays.</li>
                    <li><strong>1898</strong> - Flew his first balloon design namely “Bresil”.</li>
                    <li><strong>1898 <i>to</i> 1905</strong> - Built and flew 11 "Dirigibles". At that time, air traffic
                        control did not exist so he used to float along Paris boulevards at rooftop level in one of his
                        airships.</li>
                    <li><strong>1901</strong> - Successfully made a trip by using his Dirigible “Number 6”.</li>
                </div>
                <div class="">
                    <li><strong>1905</strong> - Completed the design of his first fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter.
                        In the next year, he flew an aircraft by piloting the “14-bis”, a canard biplane at a height of
                        about five meters or less. This event was the first flight that the Aero-Club de France
                        verified. This trip won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the first officially observed flight
                        further than 25 meters.</li>
                    <li><strong>1910</strong> - Suffered from double vision and vertigo that restricted him from driving
                        and flying. He was also under treatment for suffering from multiple sclerosis.</li>
                    <li><strong>1911</strong> - Moved to the French seaside village of Bénerville (now
                        Benerville-sur-Mer), where he took up astronomy as a hobby.</li>
                    <li><strong>1914</strong> - After the outbreak of war, his German-made telescope and unusual accent
                        led to accusations he was a German spy tracking French naval activity, and his rooms searched by
                        French police.</br>Upset by the allegation and depressed about his illness Santos-Dumont burned
                        all his papers and plans.</br>He spent much of the 1920s in Swiss and French sanatoria, though
                        returning to Brazil at times.</li>
                </div>
                <div class="">
                    <li><strong>1931</strong> - Santos Dumont's nephew went to Switzerland and brought him to Brazil.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1932</strong> - Seriously ill and said to be depressed over his multiple sclerosis and
                        the use of aircraft in warfare during São Paulo's Constitutionalist Revolution, he hanged
                        himself on July 23 in the city of Guarujá (although his death certificate gives the cause of
                        death as "cardiac collapse").</li>
